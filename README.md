# Shortest-and-Longest-path-on-DAGs

Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) allow us to easily compute shortest and longest path. The program is written in Python 3. Change the network. First column is "From_node", second column is "To_node", third column is "Cost". Use "shortestPath(origin)" and "longestPath(origin)" to run shortest and longest path, and then use "printShortestLongestPath(origin, destination)" to print shortest and longest path.
